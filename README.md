1. Run the "biodiversitySamplingSim.m" script to evaluate species richness estimators using simulated scenarios. The script calls "RichnessEstsCov.m", which is the function that takes in spatial abundance data and returns richness estimates, including Richness_raw, Chao1, Chao2, ACE, S_aj2 (Jackknife_abundance), S_ij2 (Jackknife_incidence), and Richness_apx (the proposed estimator ùõ∫o). The script also calls "RichnessEstsCov_ideal.m", which is the analogous function to the previous that uses unobserved true quantities in the simulated data to return an idealized richness estimate (ùõ∫T, the theoretical best version of ùõ∫o).

2. Run the "runEmpiricalRichnessCorrection.m" script to analyze a real multi-year, multi-site seaweed dataset. The script first loads the empirical data contained in "Data_all.mat". The script calls the function "bootRichnessEsts_all.m" to obtain bootstrapped samples of all estimators mentioned above assuming dependencies of individuals within species and sites, and otherwise calls the function "bootRichnessEsts.m" when only Richness_raw, Chao1, and Richness_apx are returned. Both functions calls "RichnessEstsCov.m" to estimate richness for every bootstrapped dataset. The bootstrap functions can optionally be replaced by "bootRichnessEsts_all_indepIndivAssumed.m" if bootstrapping should be done on individuals assuming they are independent. Plotting uses "boundedline.m" and associated files.

3. Analogous functions to "RichnessEstsCov.m" and "bootRichnessEsts.m" are provided in R. The functions take in a matrix with columns representing species, rows representing sites, and entries representing individual counts.
